Requirements:
- Python version 2.6 (should work with 2.7 as well, probably not with 3.x).
- GDB version >= 7.0. The most recent version possible is highly recommended, and at least 7.2
is highly encouraged.
- LaunchMON 0.7.2 or 1.0.
- MRNet 4.0.0.
- PyBindGen 0.15.0.
- mpi4py 1.3.

There is a Python script, depinstall.py, provided, to download, build, and install the above
versions of LaunchMON (0.7.2 is the latest packaged version), MRNet, PyBindGen and mpi4py. It
works as follows:

- To build everything: python depinstall.py [configure parameters]
This downloads, unpacks, builds, and installs the above packages. Optional parameters can be
provided that are passed verbatim to all configure scripts.
- To clean everything: python depinstall.py clean
This removes all downloaded and extracted files.

If additional control is needed, depinstall.py can be edited. Alternately, these packages may
be built manually.

Additionally, this script should automatically build and install the MRNet bindings.

Installation:
1. Install the requirements above. Ensure that PyBindGen, mpi4py, and the MRNet bindings are in
   your Python path.
2. Update the LaunchMON configuration in conf/lmonconf.py. The comments there are helpful.
   - Indicate whether you are using LaunchMON 1.0 or not.
   - For whichever version of LaunchMON you are using, update the paths for lmon_fe_lib and
   lmon_be_lib to point to the LaunchMON front- and back-end libraries.
   - Update the environment variables for LMON_PREFIX and LMON_LAUNCHMON_ENGINE_PATH for the
   LaunchMON prefix and the launchmon binary, respectively.
3. Update the GDB configuration.
   - You can set the path to load MRNet or other Python modules with:
     import sys
     sys.path.append("/path/to/installation/")
   - Update the backend_args to the full path to your gdbbe.py.
   - Update the MRNet environment variables MRNET_COMM_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to
   the MRNet mrnet_commnode binary and library directory, respectively.
   - Update the gdb_init_path to the location of the gdbinit file included here.
   - Update any other configuration options you want.
